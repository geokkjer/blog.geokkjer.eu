## Learning the C Programming language in 2022

I have been interested in the inner workings of the Linux Kernel and what goes into making an Operating System.
But I've never learned how to program in C, time to do something about it.
The following blog post will be mostly notes and randome thoughts as I follow the Head First C book and [the Learn C Programming with Dr. Chuck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-_s8f5K30I) video with the classic "The C programming Language" book by Brian W. Kernighan and
Dennis M. Ritchie.
