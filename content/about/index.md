## hi.

My name is Geir Okkenhaug Jerstad. I am Norwegian . I am interested Linux, Kubernetes, Operating Systems, Open Source programming, computer security and DevOps.

This website is being developed with [Hugo](gohugo.io) and I am using the a slightly tweked version of the [hugo-theme-console](https://github.com/mrmierzejewski/hugo-theme-console)


The idea for this site is to write some artivles about the stuff I am doing while trying to find my place in the tech/Open Source world.

My latest obsession is [NixOS](https://nixos.org) so excpect some writing on that topic.
